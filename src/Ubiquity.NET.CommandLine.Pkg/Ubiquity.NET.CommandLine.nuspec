NOTE: NuSpec Substitution macros all include a leading and trailing `$`. That syntax is
      not used in this comment to prevent build failures. The substitution is done before
      XML validation of this file, which could cause these comments to include invalid
      chars and break the build. The substitution ignores the fact that any such occurrences
      are in a comment. This is especially problematic for Local, CI, and PR builds of this
      library as the version could contain a double dash, which is invalid within an XML comment.
      Because substitution is done in memory the resulting in memory string contains the
      invalid chars, but the error is reported with a location in the generating project.
      That is, a completely incorrect source location is reported making it VERY difficult
      to find the root cause.
