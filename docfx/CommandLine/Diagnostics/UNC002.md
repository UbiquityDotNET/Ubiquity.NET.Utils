# UNC002 : Property attribute not allowed standalone
This diagnostic is reported when an attribute is detected that is a qualifier to another
required attribute, but the required attribute is not present.

## Example
`FolderValidationAttribute` provides additional information for validation of a property. To
generate source that operates correctly an additional attribute is required. For example,
to specify that a Folder provided must exist already a command can apply the
`FolderValidationAttribute`. However that attribute requires additional information to
identify the property as an option and other behaviors. Without the constrained attribute
this attribute and property it is attached to is ignored by source generation.

``` C#
using System.IO;

using Ubiquity.NET.CommandLine.GeneratorAttributes;

namespace TestNamespace;

[RootCommand( Description = "Root command for tests" )]
internal class testInput1
{
    // This attribute triggers UNC002 - Property attribute FolderValidation is not allowed on a property independent of a qualifying attribute such as OptionAttribute.
    [FolderValidation( FolderValidation.CreateIfNotExist )]
    public required DirectoryInfo SomePath { get; init; }
}
```

## Fix

``` C#
using System.IO;

using Ubiquity.NET.CommandLine.GeneratorAttributes;

namespace TestNamespace;

[RootCommand( Description = "Root command for tests" )]
internal class testInput1
{
    // Fix is to apply the attribute that indicates the property being validated
    [Option( "-o", Description = "Test SomePath" )]
    [FolderValidation( FolderValidation.CreateIfNotExist )]
    public required DirectoryInfo SomePath { get; init; }
}
```
