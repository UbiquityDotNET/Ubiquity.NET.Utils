# UNC004 : Property type is nullable but marked as required
This diagnostic is reported when a nullable type is marked as `Required`. This usually
indicates an error in the source applying the attributes. An explicitly annotated nullable
type has a legit value of null, therefore marking it as `Required` makes no sense. Required
means that it is validated as specified on the command line, this validation only occurs at
the time of ***invoking*** the command. (If a different command is parsed from the command
line arguments then no validation occurs).

## Example

``` C#
using Ubiquity.NET.CommandLine.GeneratorAttributes;

namespace TestNamespace;

[RootCommand( Description = "Root command for tests" )]
internal partial class TestOptions
{
    // Use of `Required = true` reports diagnostic; UNC004 : Property type is nullable but marked as required.
    [Option( "--thing1", Aliases = [ "-t" ], Required = true, Description = "Test Thing1", HelpName = "Help name for thing1" )]
    public bool? Thing1 { get; init; }

    [Option( "--thing2", Aliases = [ "-t" ], Description = "Test Thing2", HelpName = "Help name for thing2" )]
    public bool Thing2 { get; init; }
}
```
