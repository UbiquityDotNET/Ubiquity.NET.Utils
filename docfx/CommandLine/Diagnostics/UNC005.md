# UNC005 : Arity specified for property type is invalid.
This diagnostic indicates that the arity specified in an attribute does not match the type
of value for that property^1^. The default arity is usually enough but it is sometimes valid
to limit the "or more" default to a max value. In particular with collections there may be
a limit to the maximum number of values allowed so the arity specifies that. Not that the
arity applies to the ***values*** of a property. That is:
`--foo true` is ONLY allowed if the minimum arity is > 1, otherwise only the option itself
is allowed (for example: `--foo`). Setting the arity to a maximum that is > 1 requires a
collection type to bind the parsed values to. Setting a minimum > 0 makes it required to
specify a value for the command. That is, with a minimum arity of 1 `--foo` is an error.
